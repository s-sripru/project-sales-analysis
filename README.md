# Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive business analysis of retail sales data for the fiscal year 2023. By integrating transactional data with customer, product, and store metadata, the analysis identifies key revenue drivers, seasonal trends, and customer segment behaviors to inform data-driven business decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes four interconnected datasets:
* **Sales Transactions:** Date, quantity, unit price, and discount data.
* **Products:** Product names, categories, and pricing.
* **Customers:** Segments (Corporate, Consumer, Home Office) and marketing opt-in status.
* **Stores:** Physical store locations and regional identifiers.

## 🔄 Data Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values in the `quantity` column and resolved date format inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Calculated `net_price` (post-discount) and `total_revenue` to measure financial performance accurately.
3. **Data Integration:** Performed a multi-way merge to create a unified master dataset.
4. **Transformation:** Normalized text fields and converted categorical marketing flags into boolean values for deeper analysis.

## 📈 Key Business Insights
* **High-Value Products:** The **Ultratab 10** is the primary revenue driver ($389,370), highlighting a strong market preference for high-ticket electronics.
* **Segment Leaders:** The **Corporate** segment leads in total spend, followed by Home Office and Consumer groups.
* **Marketing Opportunity:** A significant portion of revenue is generated by customers who have **not** opted into email marketing, indicating a major untapped channel for targeted loyalty programs.
* **Efficiency:** While items like the **Office Chair** have higher sales volumes, the **Smartwatch V2** and **Ultratab 10** yield higher profit margins per unit.
